            <p>Nope, it's not just you: We live in extra-stressful times. That's why a solid self-care routine is critical to keeping your you-know-what together (at least most of the time â€” it's totally normal to have the occasional anxiety explosion.) And what taking care of yourself means is different depending not just on who you are, but on what you're going through, how much time you have, what you find makes you feel less stressed and what you can afford. Whatever your self-care routine winds up being for you, the important thing is that it gives you life, rather than sucking the life out of you.
