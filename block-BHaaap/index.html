                <p>For many people, the concept of self-love is an overblown theory and they often ignore its importance. People aspire to be perfect and perfectionism is considered a greater asset or attribute than self-love. When we talk about self-love, it is easy to picture someone reading self-help books or hugging a tree; but self-love is much more than that. A lot of studies have shown that self-love is the key to mental wellbeing and it keeps depression and anxiety at bay.</p>
